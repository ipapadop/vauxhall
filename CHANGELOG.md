# Changelog

All notable changes to Vauxhall are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
the [versioning policy](docs/releasing.md#versioning-policy).

## [Unreleased]

The first release, planned as 0.1.0. It is alpha software; see
[known limitations](https://github.com/ipapadop/vauxhall#known-limitations).

### Added

- Desktop dashboard (`vauxhall`) that shows each agent session as a card, with
  live state, an activity log, a history modal, search, sort, stale detection,
  and a settings dialog. It remembers its theme, sort order, history filter,
  and window geometry.
- Hooks for Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI, installed with
  `vauxhall-hook-install claude codex gemini` into an isolated `.vauxhall-venv`.
- `TelemetryClient` and telemetry schema version 1 for other agents.
- JSON configuration files with environment variable overrides, validated at
  startup.
- Keyboard and screen reader support for every dashboard control.
- Documentation for a first run, configuration, privacy and the data each
  integration publishes, remote monitoring over SSH, troubleshooting, and
  uninstalling.
- A complete source distribution that can run every Python and frontend test.
- A tag-triggered release workflow that tests, builds, checks, and attaches
  the wheel and source distribution to a GitHub release.
